The DSC samples repository includes the source code for tutorials and reference implementations.
Your contributions are welcome in whatever form they take - requests for new tutorials, fixes for
implementations, new language contributions for an existing tutorial, or something else.

This section contains guidance to help you effectively contribute.

## Ways to contribute

There are a few ways to contribute. All contributions are valuable to us.

- Filing issues helps us identify problems and gaps in our documentation. Sometimes the issues are
  difficult to resolve, requiring more investigation and research. The issue process allows us to
  have a conversation abou the problem and develop a satisfactory resolution.
- Submitting a pull request to add or change content and code is a more involved process. The
  following information outlines the tools, processes, and standards for submitting content and
  code to the samples repository.

If you're interested in submitting a new tutorial or adding an implementation to an existing one,
see [Contributing a tutorial][01].
