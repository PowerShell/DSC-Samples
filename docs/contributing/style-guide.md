This section includes guidance for styling both prose and code in the DSC Samples.

## Code Style

In general, the source code included in the repository should use the default style guide for that
language. If the style guide for a language is ambiguous, prefer readability over elegance and
concision. The sample code must be functional, but it must also be readable by a wide audience.

## Prose Style

When authoring prose for sample code documentation and tutorials, adhere to the [Vale][01] style
rules and [markdownlint][02] syntax rules. This repository is setup to automatically lint prose for
different issues and practices.
