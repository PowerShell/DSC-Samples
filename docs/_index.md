## DSC samples and tutorials

Starting with v3, Microsoft's Desired State Configuration (DSC) supports implementing DSC Resources
in any language as command-based resources.

This site includes sample implementations for DSC Resources and accompanying documentation. For a
list of tutorials by purpose, with sample implementation in multiple languages, see
[Tutorials][01]. For a list of tutorials by language, see [Languages][02].

You can find more information about DSC in the [official documentation][03].

If you're interested in filing bugs, requesting samples or tutorials, or otherwise contributing,
see [Contributing to the DSC Samples][04].
